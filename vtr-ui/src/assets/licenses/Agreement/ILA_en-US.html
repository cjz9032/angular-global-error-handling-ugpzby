<h1>Software license agreements, Lenovo Software Privacy Statement, and Lenovo Limited
Warranty</h1>

<p>This document provides the Lenovo License Agreement, third-party software license
agreements, the Lenovo Software Privacy Statement, and the Lenovo Limited
Warranty for hardware products. Collectively, the Lenovo License Agreement and
the third-party software license agreements apply to software preinstalled on a
standard model computer.  In some cases, such as custom models containing
customer-provided images or software, some of the third-party software licenses
might not apply to you.</p>

<p>Lenovo may automatically download and install
critical updates without providing notification to the user. Updates are
classified as critical when they are needed for the computer to function
properly. Failure to install critical updates could result in data corruption
or loss, a major system malfunction, or a hardware failure. For example,
critical updates could include an update to the hard-disk-drive firmware, a
BIOS upgrade, a device-driver fix, or a fix for the operating system or other
preinstalled software. The user can turn off the automatic download and
installation of critical updates by changing the default settings of the
program after the initial setup.</p>

<h2><a id="LLA">Lenovo License Agreement</a></h2>

<p><b>L505-0009-06-R  10/2015</b></p>

<p><b>This
Lenovo License Agreement (the "Agreement") applies to each Lenovo Software
Product that You acquire, whether it is preinstalled on or included with a
Lenovo hardware product, acquired separately, or downloaded by You from a
Lenovo Web site or a third-party Web site approved by Lenovo.  It also applies
to any updates or patches to these Software Products. This license agreement
does not apply to non-Lenovo software that's either preloaded on or downloaded
to your product.</b> Also, certain Software Products developed by or for Lenovo in conjunction with a
third party may be governed under separate terms. Therefore, for more
information on non-Lenovo or co-developed Software Products, please review the
license agreements or terms associated with those products. This Lenovo License Agreement is available in
other languages at <u>https://support.lenovo.com/us/en/solutions/ht100141</u></p>

<p><b>Lenovo will license the Software Product to You only if You accept this Agreement. 
You agree to the terms of this Agreement by clicking to accept it or by
installing, downloading, or using the Software Product.</b></p>

<p><b>If You do not agree to these terms, do not install, download, or use the Software
Product(s).</b></p>

<ul>
<li><b>If You acquired the Software Product(s) and paid a
license fee, return the Software Product to the party from whom You acquired it
to obtain a refund or a credit of the amount You paid.</b></li>

<li><b>If You acquired the Software Product(s) preinstalled on
or provided with a Lenovo hardware product, You may continue to use the
hardware product, but not the Software Product(s) covered under this Agreement.
</b></li>

</ul>
<p><b>"Software Product"</b> 
includes Lenovo computer software programs (whether preinstalled or provided
separately) and related licensed materials such as documentation.</p>

<p><b>"You"</b> and "<b>Your"</b>
refer either to an individual person or to a single legal entity.</p>

<p>
<b>1. Entitlement</b></p>
<p>
You must maintain Your original dated sales transaction document, such as a
receipt, invoice or similar document, as Your proof of Your right to use the
Software Product.  The transaction document specifies the usage level
acquired.CIf no usage level is specified, You may install and use a single
copy of the Software Product on a single hardware product.  Your transaction
document also provides evidence of Your eligibility for future upgrades, if
any.  For Software Products preinstalled on, included with, or distributed at
no charge for use on a Lenovo hardware product, Your hardware product sales
transaction document is also the proof of Your right to use the Software
Product.</p>

<p>
<b>2. License</b></p>

<p>
The Software Product is owned by Lenovo or a Lenovo supplier, and is copyrighted
and licensed, not sold.  Lenovo grants You a nonexclusive license to use the
Software Product when You lawfully acquire it. </p>

<p>
You may <b>a)</b> use the Software Product up to the level of use specified in Your
transaction document and<b> b)</b> make and install copies, including a backup
copy, to support such use.  The terms of this Agreement apply to each copy You
make.  You may not remove or alter any copyright notices or legends of
ownership.</p>

<p>
If You acquire the Software Product as a program upgrade, after You install the
upgrade You may not use the Software Product from which You upgraded or
transfer it to another party.</p>

<p>
You will ensure that anyone who uses the Software Product (accessed either locally
or remotely) does so only for Your authorized use and complies with the terms
of this Agreement. </p>

<p>
You may not <b>a)</b> use, copy, modify, or distribute the
Software Product except as provided in this Agreement or in any way that
violates any applicable laws including but not limited to copyright laws; <b>b)</b>
reverse assemble, reverse compile, or otherwise translate the Software Product
except as specifically permitted by law without the possibility of contractual
waiver; or <b>c)</b> sublicense, rent, or lease the Software Product. </p>

<p>
Lenovo may terminate Your license if You fail to comply with the terms of this Agreement.
If Lenovo does so, You must destroy all copies of the Software Product.</p>

<p>
Lenovo uses the System Update program to update Software Products on your computer.  By
default, critical updates are downloaded and installed automatically.  Updates
are classified as critical when they are needed for the computer to function
properly.  Failure to install critical updates could result in data corruption
or loss, a major system malfunction, or a hardware failure.  For example,
critical updates could include an update to the hard-disk-drive firmware, a
BIOS upgrade, a device-driver fix, or a fix for the operating system or other
preinstalled software.  You can disable this automatic feature by changing the
settings of the System Update program at any time.</p>

<p>
<b>3. Transferability </b></p>

<p>
You may not transfer or assign the Software Product to any other party, except as
permitted in this section.</p>

<p>
Preinstalled Software Products are licensed for use only on the Lenovo hardware product on
which they are preinstalled or included with and may be transferred only with
that Lenovo hardware product.  They may not be transferred independent of the
Lenovo hardware product.</p>

<p>
<b>4. Third Party Software Components and Products </b></p>

<p>
Some
Lenovo Software Products and future updates and patches may contain third party
components, which may include Microsoft Windows Preinstallation Environment.  These
third party components are provided to You under separate terms and conditions
different from this Agreement, typically found in a separate license agreement
or in a README (or similarly titled) file.  The third party's license terms and
use restrictions will solely govern the use of such components.</p>

<p>
Third Party Software Products provided by Lenovo may be governed by the terms of this
Agreement but are usually licensed by the Third Party under its own terms and
conditions.  Third Party Software Products that are not licensed by Lenovo are
subject solely to the terms of their accompanying license agreements.</p>

<p>
<b>5. Software Product Specifications</b></p>

<p>
The Software Product specifications and specified operating environment information
may be found in documentation accompanying the Software Product, if available,
such as a README or similarly titled file, or otherwise published by Lenovo.</p>

<p>
<b>6. Privacy </b></p>

<p>
<b> Please review the Lenovo privacy policy statement (<u>https://www3.lenovo.com/us/en/privacy/</u>) 
that's associated with
your product.  Depending on your particular Lenovo device or software product,
the Lenovo privacy statement (<u>https://www3.lenovo.com/us/en/privacy/</u>)
is located at the point of activation and set-up and/or via "Settings".</b></p>

<p>
 <b>7. Charges </b></p>

<p>
Charges for the Software Product are based on the level of use acquired.</p>

<p>
If You wish to increase the level of use, contact Lenovo or the party from whom
You acquired the Software Product.  Additional charges may apply.</p>

<p>
If any authority imposes a duty, tax, levy or fee, excluding those based on
Lenovo's net income, upon the Software Product, then You agree to pay the
amount specified or supply exemption documentation.  You are responsible for
any personal property taxes for the Software Product from the date that You
acquire it.</p>

<p>
<b>8. No Warranty </b></p>

<p>
<b>The Software Product(s) is provided to You "AS IS."</b></p>

<p>
<b> SUBJECT TO ANY STATUTORY WARRANTIES WHICH CANNOT BE EXCLUDED, LENOVO MAKES NO
WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, REGARDING THE SOFTWARE PRODUCT OR
TECHNICAL SUPPORT, IF ANY. </b></p>

<p>
The exclusion also applies to any of Lenovo's developers and suppliers.</p>

<p>
Suppliers or publishers of non-Lenovo Software Products may provide their own warranties.</p>

<p>
Lenovo does not provide technical support, unless Lenovo specifies otherwise in
writing.</p>

<p>
<b>9. Limitation of Liability</b></p>


<p>
Circumstances may arise where, because of a default on Lenovo's part or other liability, You
may be entitled to recover damages from Lenovo.  In each such instance,
regardless of the basis on which You are entitled to claim damages from Lenovo
(including fundamental breach, negligence, misrepresentation, or other contract
or tort claim), except and to the extent that liability cannot be waived or
limited by applicable laws, Lenovo is liable for no more than the amount of
actual direct damages suffered by You, up to the amount You paid for the
Software Product.  This limit does not apply to damages for bodily injury
(including death) and damage to real property and tangible personal property
for which Lenovo is required by law to be liable.</p>

<p>
This
limit also applies to Lenovo's suppliers and resellers.  It is the maximum for
which Lenovo, its suppliers and resellers are collectively responsible.</p>

<p>
<b> UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES IS LENOVO, ITS SUPPLIERS OR RESELLERS LIABLE FOR ANY OF THE
FOLLOWING EVEN IF INFORMED OF THEIR POSSIBILITY: 1) THIRD PARTY CLAIMS AGAINST
YOU FOR DAMAGES; 2) LOSS OF, OR DAMAGE TO, YOUR DATA; OR 3) SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, OR INDIRECT DAMAGES OR FOR ANY ECONOMIC CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES,
INCLUDING LOST PROFITS, BUSINESS REVENUE, GOODWILL, OR ANTICIPATED SAVINGS.  SOME
STATES OR JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL
OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO
YOU.</b></p>

<p>
<b> 10. Consumer Rights</b></p>

<p>
Nothing in this Agreement affects any statutory rights of consumers that cannot be
waived or limited by contract.  You may have additional consumer rights under
applicable local laws, which this Agreement cannot change.</p>

<p>
<b>11. General</b></p>

<p class="Indent25">
a) In the event that any provision of this Agreement is
held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions of this Agreement
remain in full force and effect.</p>

<p class="Indent25">
b) You agree to comply with all applicable export and
import laws and regulations.</p>

<p class="Indent25">
c) Neither You nor Lenovo will bring a legal action under
this Agreement more than two (2) years after the cause of action arose unless
otherwise provided by local law without the possibility of contractual waiver
or limitation.</p>

<p>
<b> 12. Dispute Resolution </b></p>

<p>
If You acquired the Software Product in <b>Cambodia, Indonesia, Philippines,
Vietnam or Sri Lanka</b>, disputes arising out of or in connection with this
Software Product shall be finally settled by arbitration held in Singapore and
this Agreement shall be governed, construed and enforced in accordance with the
laws of Singapore, without regard to conflict of laws.  If You acquired the
Software Product in <b>India</b>, disputes arising out of or in connection with
this Software Product shall be finally settled by arbitration held in
Bangalore, India.  Arbitration in Singapore shall be held in accordance with
the Arbitration Rules of Singapore International Arbitration Center (&quot;SIAC
Rules&quot;) then in effect.  Arbitration in India shall be held in accordance
with the laws of India then in effect.  The arbitration award shall be final
and binding for the parties without appeal and shall be in writing and set
forth the findings of fact and the conclusions of law.  All arbitration
proceedings shall be conducted, including all documents presented in such
proceedings, in the English language, and the English language version of this
Agreement prevails over any other language version in such proceedings.</p>

<p>
<b>This privacy statement was last updated on October 8, 2015.</b></p>

<p>
This privacy statement describes how Lenovo collects, uses,
and protects information about your Lenovo device &ndash; such as a PC, Windows tablet,
or notebook &ndash; through our software, including Lenovo pre-installed applications,
as well as information you may choose to provide to us, such as by registering
your device and creating a Lenovo ID. Please note that this privacy statement
does not apply to non-Lenovo software on your device, such as Microsoft
applications. Also, certain software developed by or for Lenovo in conjunction

more about Lenovo's Web-site privacy practices by
visiting <u>https://www3.lenovo.com/us/en/privacy/</u> </p>

<p>
<i>We reserve the right to make changes to this privacy
statement at any time. If we make a change to this privacy policy, we will make
the new version and previous versions available on <u>https://www.lenovo.com</u> so
that you can see when changes occurred and what they are.</i></p>

<h3>What Information does Lenovo collect and how do we use it? </h3>

<p>
Lenovo uses information to keep your Lenovo products working
at their best and help you make the most of them. This includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Keeping your Lenovo software up-to-date.</b> &nbsp;We're
always working to provide updates that deliver new features and fix bugs. We
collect and use information we need to keep your Lenovo software up to date. </li>

<li>
<b>Help improve Lenovo products and enhance device support.</b> &nbsp;We want 
to ensure your products, services, and software
are always working at their best. We collect and use information to identify
performance trends, prioritize bug fixes, develop new features, and
troubleshoot issues you might be having with your Lenovo software. If you
decide you'd like us to stop collecting information on how you use Lenovo
applications, you can turn off Usage Statistics in the Settings menu of certain
applications, or disable or uninstall certain applications.</li>

<li>
<b>Creating an anonymous user profile.</b>&nbsp;We
may create a profile of your use of our products, services, and Web sites based
on information we have collected from you and your Lenovo products. Lenovo will
collect basic information about which applications, services, and offers you
choose during system setup. In order to make your experience more useful and
enjoyable, we may also collect information on how you use your Lenovo device
(including components). This information is kept anonymous and is not
associated with your personal information described below. We use the profile
to provide services and support and to make improvements to our offerings.</li>

<li>
<b>Creating a Lenovo ID and registering
your product.</b> &nbsp;We also collect information, including personal information,
when you create your Lenovo ID and when you register your products with us.
Your Lenovo ID will be one way in which Lenovo identifies you when you interact
with our online services such as our ecommerce and e-support Web sites. Along
with your Lenovo ID, we may collect and store additional information, such as
your name (as provided by you), e-mail address, user language and
region/county, machine type-model (the type of device you use), your device IP
address, device ID, serial number, the date you registered your device, and
operating-system activation data. Your Lenovo ID will not be associated with
the anonymous software data discussed in the paragraph above. You may
deactivate your Lenovo ID at any point.</li>

<li>
<b>Providing Lenovo software and device functionality.</b>   
&nbsp;Some Lenovo products and software applications need access to
information in order to function. They may keep the information locally on your
Lenovo products or they may transfer it to Lenovo or a third party. Lenovo will
only access such information if you specifically choose to enable or use these
functions. The Lenovo Settings application includes an interface in which you
can change your data collection settings for many Lenovo applications. If you
need instructions on how to uninstall applications, please consult the Lenovo
Support site (<u>https://support.lenovo.com</u>).</li>

<li>
<b>E-mail Communications. </b> &nbsp;If
you choose to receive e-mail from Lenovo, we will collect, store, and use your
name and e-mail address to send you product support announcements and/or
promotional messages. You can unsubscribe by using the unsubscribe link at the
bottom of our promotional messages. </li>
</ul>

<h3> What kind of third parties does Lenovo share information with? </h3>

<ul>
<li>
We limit the sharing of information
described in this privacy statement to certain types of third parties who help
us use it for purposes to which you have agreed. These include:</li>
<ul>
<li>
Service providers who provide hosting,
data analyses, and customer support functions.</li>

<li>
Lenovo affiliates who help provide
functionality for Lenovo software and who help us use information as described
in this privacy statement.</li>
</ul>
<li>
In special circumstances, we may also
share your information with others, including:

<ul>
<li>
Law enforcement and other government
agencies where legally required to do so.</li>

<li>
Other third parties helping us protect
our rights, our users' rights, and the rights of others, such as during
litigation.
</li>

</ul>
</ul>

<h3>   
How does Lenovo store and protect information we've collected and shared?</h3>

<p>   
We use standard technical and organizational safeguards when
we transmit information from Lenovo products to our servers, when we store
data, and when we share it with third parties. However, please remember that no
data storage or transmission method can be guaranteed to be completely
invulnerable, so you understand that you use Lenovo products at your own risk. </p>

<p>   
Our products include features designed to help you protect
the information you store on your Lenovo products. These may include solutions
like encryption, password and PIN unlock, and remote control over your Lenovo
products so you can locate, lock, and erase lost or stolen devices. You can
learn more about available features by accessing your Lenovo products' Security
settings. </p>

<p>
When we collect information described in this privacy
statement, we will retain it on our servers as long as necessary to support the
Lenovo products you are using and to comply with applicable laws and our own
policies. We may transfer, use, and store information that the Lenovo product
collects outside of the country from which it came. These places may include
jurisdictions whose privacy laws do not provide equivalent protection to such
laws in your home country. Wherever these activities occur, we take appropriate
steps to treat your information securely and in accordance with this privacy
statement, our terms of use, and applicable laws and regulations. Use of Lenovo
products constitutes your specific consent to the transfer of information
described in this privacy policy. </p>

<h3>What about my child's privacy? </h3>

<p>
Lenovo products are intended for adults and children ages 13
and up who have permission to use them from their parents or legal guardians.
We do not seek to collect information about children under the age of 13 and
will delete any as soon as we discover it. We also encourage parents to
actively supervise their children's use of Lenovo products.</p>

<h3>12. Dispute Resolution: </h3>

<p>Symantec believes that most disagreements can be resolved informally and efficiently by contacting Symantec customer support.  If You are a U.S. customer, and the dispute is not resolved through Symantec customer support, You and Symantec agree that any such dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating in any way to the Software and Services or this License Agreement (a “Claim”), shall be determined by binding arbitration or small claims court, instead of in courts of general jurisdiction, as follows:  </p>

<ol type="A">

<li>Small Claims Court:  You may elect to litigate your Claim in small claims court if all the requirements of the small claims court are satisfied, including any limitations on jurisdiction and the amount at issue in the dispute.  You agree to bring a Claim in small claims court in your county of residence or in the Superior Court of California, County of Santa Clara. </li>
<li>Arbitration:  Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.  Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts.  Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.  You agree that, by agreeing to this License Agreement, the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration provision, and that You and Symantec are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.  This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this License Agreement and/or the termination of Your Symantec product license.</li>
<br>
<ol type="a">
<li>Notice of Claim:  If You elect to seek arbitration, You must first send to Symantec, by certified mail, a written Notice of Your Claim ("Notice of Claim").  The Notice of Claim to Symantec should be addressed to: General Counsel, Symantec, Inc., 350 Ellis Street, Mountain View, CA 94043 and should be prominently captioned “NOTICE OF CLAIM”.   The Notice of Claim should include both the mailing address and email address You would like Symantec to use to contact You.  If Symantec elects to seek arbitration, it will send, by certified mail, a written Notice of Claim to Your billing address on file.  A Notice of Claim, whether sent by You or by Symantec, must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; (b) set forth the specific amount of damages or other relief sought ("Demand"); and (c) whether You reject any subsequent modification of the Dispute Resolution section by Symantec (see Section 12(B)(e)). </li>

<li>Arbitration Proceedings:  If You and Symantec do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within thirty (30) days after the Notice of Claim is received, You or Symantec may commence an arbitration proceeding (or, alternatively, file a claim in small claims court).  You may download or copy a form of notice and a form to initiate arbitration at https://www.adr.org.  The arbitration will be governed by the Consumer or Commercial Arbitration Rules, as appropriate, of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") (collectively, the "AAA Rules"), as modified by this License Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA.  The AAA Rules and Forms are available online at https://www.adr.org.  The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this License Agreement.  All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to the scope and enforceability of this arbitration provision.
<p>
Unless Symantec and You agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of either Your residence or of the mailing address You provided in Your Notice of Claim.  If Your claim is for U.S. $10,000 or less, Symantec agrees that You may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules.  If Your claim exceeds U.S. $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.  Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.  If the arbitrator issues You an award that is greater than the value of Symantec’s last written settlement offer made before an arbitrator was selected (or if Symantec did not make a settlement offer before an arbitrator was selected), then Symantec will pay You, in addition to the award, either U.S. $500 or 10% of the amount awarded, whichever is greater.
</p>
</li>

<li>Injunctive and Declaratory Relief:  Except as set forth in Section 12(A), the arbitrator shall determine all issues of liability on the merits of any claim asserted by You or Symantec, and may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim.  To the extent that You or Symantec prevail on a claim and seek public injunctive relief (that is, injunctive relief that has the primary purpose and effect of prohibiting unlawful acts that threaten future injury to the general public), the entitlement to and extent of such relief must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration.  The parties agree that litigation of any issues of public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of the merits of any individual claims in arbitration.</li>

<li>Arbitration Fees:  If Your claim for damages does not exceed $10,000, Symantec will pay all fees imposed by the AAA to conduct the arbitration, including reimbursement of Your initial filing fee, unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of Your claim or the relief sought in Your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). If Your claim for damages exceeds $10,000, standard AAA Rules will govern the payment of all AAA fees, including filing, administration and arbitrator fees.   </li>

<li>Class Action Waiver:&nbsp; <b>YOU AND SYMANTEC AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.</b>  Further, if You have elected arbitration, unless both You and Symantec agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims with Your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.  If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Dispute Resolution section shall be null and void. </li>

<li>Modification of Dispute Resolution Section:  Notwithstanding Section 2(A), if Symantec changes this “Dispute Resolution” section after the date You first accepted this License Agreement, and You have not otherwise affirmatively agreed to such changes, You may reject any such change by so stating within Your Notice of Claim.  By failing to reject any changes to this Dispute Resolution section in Your Notice of Claim, You agree to resolve any Claim between You and Symantec in accordance with the terms of the Dispute Resolution section in effect as of the date of Your Notice of Claim.  Current versions of license agreements for Symantec products can be found at <u>https://www.symantec.com/about/profile/policies/eulas/</u>. </li>

<li>Severability:  With the exception of any of the provisions in Section 12(B)(e) of this Agreement ("Class Action Waiver"), if an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction decides that any part of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this Agreement shall still apply.</li>

  <p><strong>4. TERMS SPECIFIC TO IDENTITY PROTECTION SERVICES. </strong></p>              
  <p>These terms <strong>only apply</strong> if you have enrolled in, are entitled to, or use our identity protection services from us or one of our trusted partners (these Services are sometimes referred to as the “Identity Protection Services”).</p>
  <p>The Identity Protection Services are only available to residents of the United States who possess a valid social security number. While enrolling for the Services, we will ask you for the following types of information: (i) contact information (such as name, address, phone number, and e-mail address); (ii) identity related information (such as date of birth, driver’s license number and social security number); (iii) information to verify your identity and financial information (such as credit card number). This information is required in order to verify your identity, charge you the agreed upon fees for our Services, and to fulfill our obligation to provide our Services to you, including monitoring your identity and communicating with third parties as necessary to provide such Services, such as, for example, identification verification companies, third party service providers, third party data suppliers, consumer reporting agencies, credit bureaus, payment validation companies, law enforcement agencies, or others. McAfee’s Privacy Notice (<u>https://www.mcafee.com/consumer/en-us/legal.html</u>) <strong>outlines the manner in which we (or others acting on our behalf) collect, use, and share information about you in connection with your use of the Identity Protection Services, and it is your responsibility to review our Privacy Notice prior to agreeing to this License Agreement or before using our Services.</strong></p>              
  <p>You understand that by accepting this Agreement and using our Identity Protection Services, you are providing us and our employees, agents, subsidiaries, affiliates, contractors, third-party service providers and data providers, and all other credit reporting agencies under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), as amended, including Experian, TransUnion, Equifax, and affiliated entities, written instructions (as described in these terms), consent and authorization to access and use consumer reports, including credit reports, about you (or about any children you have enrolled, if applicable) from each national credit or consumer reporting agency and to exchange information about you with third party data providers and each such national credit reporting agency in order to verify and monitor your identity and to provide the Identity Protection Services to you.</p>
  <p><u>Fair Credit Reporting Act</u>. The Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”) allows you to obtain from each consumer reporting agency a disclosure of all the information in your consumer file at the time of the request. Full disclosure of information in your file at a consumer reporting agency must be obtained directly from such consumer reporting agency. The consumer reports provided by or requested from McAfee Identity Protection are not intended to constitute the disclosure of information by a consumer reporting agency as required by the FCRA or similar laws.</p>              
  <p>Under the FCRA you are entitled to receive an annual free disclosure of your credit report from each of the national credit reporting agencies. You may request your free annual report under the FCRA, at <u>https://www.annualcreditreport.com</u>. </p>
  <p>You are also entitled to receive a free copy of your credit report from a consumer reporting agency if:</p>              
  <p>You have been denied or were otherwise notified of an adverse action related to consumer, insurance, employment, or a government granted license or other government granted benefit within the past 60 days based on information in a consumer report provided by such agency.</p>
  <p>You have been denied house/apartment rental or were required to pay a higher deposit than usually required within the past 60 days based on information in a consumer report provided by such agency.</p>              
  <p>You certify in writing that you are unemployed and intend to apply for employment during the 60 day period beginning on the date on which you made such certification.</p>
  <p>You certify in writing that you are a recipient of public welfare assistance.</p>              
  <p><strong>You certify in writing that you have reason to believe that your file at such consumer reporting agency contains inaccurate information due to fraud.</strong></p>
  <p>In addition, if you reside in the state of Colorado, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, or Vermont, you are entitled to receive a free copy of your consumer report once a year and if you reside in the state of Georgia, you are entitled to receive a free copy of your consumer report twice a year. For Illinois residents, consumer reporting agencies are required by law to give you a copy of your consumer record upon request at no charge or for a nominal fee. Otherwise, a consumer reporting agency may impose a reasonable charge for providing you with a copy of your consumer report.</p>
  <p>The Fair Consumer Reporting Act provides that you may dispute inaccurate or incomplete information in your consumer report. YOU ARE NOT REQUIRED TO PURCHASE YOUR CONSUMER REPORT FROM ANY OF THE CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCIES IN ORDER TO DISPUTE INACCURATE OR INCOMPLETE INFORMATION IN YOUR REPORT OR TO RECEIVE A COPY OF YOUR REPORT FROM EQUIFAX, EXPERIAN OR TRANSUNION, THE THREE NATIONAL CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCIES, OR FROM ANY OTHER CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCY.</p>
  <p>It may be the policies of Equifax, Experian and/or TransUnion to provide a complimentary copy of the consumer report under circumstances other than those described above. If you wish to contact Equifax, Experian or TransUnion to obtain a copy of your consumer report directly from such agency or if you wish to dispute information contained in an Equifax, Experian or TransUnion credit report file, please contact such entities as follows:</p>

   <p><strong>5. BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER</strong></p>
   
   <p><strong>For all non-European Union customers.</strong></p>
   <p><strong>Agreement to Arbitrate Disputes</strong>. Any claim, dispute or controversy of any kind, regardless of the type of claim or legal theory or remedy (“Claim”) by either you or us against the other arising from, relating to or in any way concerning the Agreement, the Software, or any equipment, products, or Services you receive from us (or from any advertising for any such products or services) will, at the demand of either party, be resolved by confidential binding arbitration. This agreement to arbitrate also includes: (i) Claims relating to the enforceability or interpretation of any of these arbitration provisions; (ii) Claims by you, and also Claims made on your behalf or connected with you, such as an employee, representative, agent, predecessor, successor, heir, assignee, or trustee in bankruptcy; (iii) Claims that relate directly to us, and/or to our parent, affiliates, successors, assignees, employees, and agents; and (iv) Claims asserted as part of a class action, private attorney general or other representative action, it being expressly understood and agreed to that the arbitration of such claims must proceed on an individual (non-class and non-representative) basis and the arbitrator may award relief only on an individual (non-class and non-representative) basis. YOU AND WE AGREE THAT NO CLASS ACTION, CONSOLIDATED ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE CLAIMS MAY BE PURSUED IN ARBITRATION, NOR MAY SUCH ACTIONS BE PURSUED IN COURT. BY ACCEPTING THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, YOU AGREE TO WAIVE THE RIGHT TO INITIATE OR PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR CONSOLIDATED ARBITRATION IN ANY MATTER ENCOMPASSED BY THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION.</p>
   <p><strong>Notice of Dispute</strong>. The party seeking arbitration must first notify the other party of the dispute in writing at least 60 days in advance of initiating arbitration. Notice should be sent to McAfee, 5000 Headquarters Drive, Plano, TX 75024, Attention: Legal Department. The notice must include your name, address, and contact information, the facts giving rise to the dispute, and the relief requested. You and we will use reasonable efforts to resolve any dispute through informal negotiation within 60 days from the date the notice of dispute is sent. After 60 days, you or we may commence arbitration.</p>
   <p><strong>Administration of Arbitration</strong>. If any dispute is not resolved by informal negotiation, any claim, dispute, or controversy will be, at the demand of either party, conducted exclusively by binding arbitration governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”), and not state law. <strong>YOU ARE GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE (OR PARTICIPATE IN AS A PARTY OR CLASS MEMBER) ALL DISPUTES IN COURT BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY.</strong> Instead, all disputes will be resolved on an individual basis before a single, neutral arbitrator and the proceeding will be confidential. The arbitrator will be either a lawyer admitted to practice law in his or her jurisdiction and with at least ten years’ experience or a retired or former judge selected in accordance with the rules of the AAA. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement, and the arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes of the AAA, as modified by this Agreement (the “Arbitration Rules”). For more information, see adr.org or call 1-800-778-7879. Except with respect to any claims or counterclaims seeking less than $25,000, the arbitrator will issue a reasoned, written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. All arbitration proceedings will be conducted in English, and the United States FAA will govern the interpretation, enforcement, and proceedings pursuant to the binding arbitration clause in this Agreement. The award will be confidential and only disclosed as is necessary to obtain judgment or as otherwise required by law. You and we further agree that a judgment may be entered upon the award by any court having jurisdiction. The arbitration award will determine the rights and obligations between the named parties only, and only in respect to the claims in arbitration, and will not have any bearing on the rights and obligations of any other dispute.</p>
   <p><strong>Costs</strong>. The party initiating the arbitration will pay the initial filing fee. If you file the arbitration and an award is rendered in your favor, we will reimburse your filing fee. We will pay the fees and costs for the first day of any hearing. All other fees and costs will be allocated in accordance with the arbitration rules. However, we will advance or reimburse filing and other fees if the arbitrator rules that you cannot afford to pay them or if you ask us and we determine there is a good reason for doing so. Each party will bear the expense of their respective attorneys, experts, and witnesses and other expenses, regardless of who prevails, but a party may recover any or all expenses from another party if the arbitrator, applying applicable law, so determines.</p>
   <p><strong>Right to Resort to Provisional Remedies Preserved</strong>. Nothing herein will be deemed to limit or constrain our right to resort to self-help remedies or to comply with legal process, or to obtain provisional remedies such as injunctive relief, attachment, or garnishment by a court having appropriate jurisdiction; provided, however, that you or we may elect to arbitrate any dispute related to such provisional remedies.</p>
   <p><strong>Conflicting Terms</strong>. In the event of a conflict between the Arbitration Rules and this arbitration agreement, this arbitration agreement will govern. If any portion of this arbitration agreement is deemed invalid or unenforceable, it will not invalidate the other provisions of the arbitration agreement; provided, however, that (a) if the prohibition on class-wide arbitration is deemed invalid, then this entire arbitration agreement will be null and void; and (b) if the prohibition on arbitration of representative claims brought in a private attorney general capacity is deemed invalid, then the arbitration agreement will be null and void as to such claims only. This arbitration agreement will survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement. In the event of a conflict between this arbitration agreement and any other applicable arbitration provision, this arbitration agreement will control.</p>
  <p><strong>WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. IF FOR ANY REASON A CLAIM PROCEEDS IN COURT RATHER THAN THROUGH ARBITRATION, YOU AND WE AGREE THAT THERE WILL NOT BE A JURY TRIAL. YOU AND WE UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY DISPUTE THAT IN ANY WAY RELATES TO OR ARISES OUT OF THE AGREEMENT OR FROM ANY EQUIPMENT, PRODUCTS AND SERVICES YOU RECEIVE FROM US (OR FROM ANY ADVERTISING FOR ANY SUCH PRODUCTS OR SERVICES). IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, THIS PARAGRAPH MAY BE FILED TO SHOW A WRITTEN CONSENT TO A TRIAL BY THE COURT. This paragraph in no way invalidates the Agreement to Arbitrate Disputes.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>For European Union Customers – Online Dispute Resolution Service (“ODR”) & Alternative Dispute Resolution (“ADR”).</strong> We are required by law to provide a link from our website to the EU ODR Platform <u>https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/main/index.cfm</u>. We are not obligated to use ADR should you have a complaint with us. If you do have a complaint with us which we cannot resolve using our internal complaints handling procedures, we will contact you by letter or email about whether we are prepared to submit to ADR. You may contact us through our website (<u>https://home.mcafee.com/SupportPages/<div>PoliciesAndAgreement.aspx?culture=en-us</u>).</p>
  

    <p><strong>6. GENERAL LEGAL TERMS</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Law Covering This Agreement</strong>. Except as provided in the Local Law Section below, this Agreement, the use of the Software and Services, the relationship of the parties, and any disputes arising out of, concerning, or relating to the Agreement, including any disputes between you and us, will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of New York, excluding its conflict of law principles, except that the FAA governs all provisions relating to arbitration. If for any reason, the laws of the state of New York are found not to apply, then, except as provided in the Local Law Section below, this Agreement, the use of the Software, Services, the relationship of the parties, and any disputes arising out of, concerning, or relating to the Agreement, including any disputes between you and us, will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of Delaware, excluding its conflict of law principles, except that the FAA governs all provisions relating to arbitration. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act do not apply to the Software or Services.</p>
  <p><strong>Attacks on Data</strong>. You acknowledge that some security breaches involve attacks on data. For example, there are viruses and other malware that: (i) delete or destroy your data (sometimes individual files, but sometimes even an entire disk by corrupting a master boot record or other key element); (ii) modify your files (such as parasitic malware that attaches itself to a file and modifies the file to enable its own execution and/or propagation); and (iii) encrypt files on your drive (such as ransomware that uses asymmetric encryption). The best way for you to protect yourself from these types of attacks is frequent back-ups of your data to another device or location. That way, you have another copy of the data that the attacking software has deleted, modified, or destroyed. While we will use commercially reasonable efforts to remove the attacking malware or virus, it is your sole and exclusive responsibility to back-up all data and files on your device so that they can be restored in the event of an attack on your data. Without such a back-up, it may not be possible to restore the deleted, destroyed, or modified data. We will have no liability for loss of or recovery of data, or files or loss of use of systems or networks arising from attacks on data.</p>
  <p><strong>Limited Warranty</strong>. For 30 days after the purchase date (“Warranty Period”), for paid versions of the Software only, we warrant that the Software licensed under this Agreement (including updates provided during the Warranty Period but not for updates provided outside of the Warranty Period) will perform substantially in accordance with the documentation provided by us in connection with that Software at the time of purchase, and that any tangible medium (such as a CD-ROM, but excluding devices manufactured by other companies) on which the Software is contained and provided to you will be free from defects in materials and workmanship. We do not warrant or guarantee that any particular mobile device or computer will be compatible with or function with the Software or Service, nor do we warrant or accept any liability for the operation of your personal equipment that is used to access the Software or Service. Your sole remedy, and our and our suppliers’ entire liability, in case of any breach of this limited warranty is that we will, at our option, refund the price you paid for the license, replace the defective medium that contains the Software, re-perform the Service, or provide an alternative remedy as required by local consumer law in your jurisdiction. These remedies may not be available in some countries to the extent that we are subject to restrictions under applicable export-control laws and regulations. If the tangible medium is defective, you must return it at your expense to the place where you bought it and provide a copy of your receipt. Any replacement medium will be warranted for the remainder of the original Warranty Period. </p>
  <p><strong>DISCLAIMER</strong>. THE ABOVE WARRANTIES ARE YOUR EXCLUSIVE WARRANTIES. THEY REPLACE ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, REPRESENTATIONS, TERMS OR CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, PERFORMANCE, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. EXCEPT FOR THE LIMITED WARRANTY IN THIS SECTION, THE SOFTWARE AND SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS”. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR SELECTING THE SOFTWARE AND SERVICES TO ACHIEVE YOUR INTENDED RESULTS, FOR INSTALLING AND USING THE SOFTWARE OR SERVICE, AND FOR THE RESULTS OBTAINED. WE DO NOT WARRANT OR GUARANTEE THE SOFTWARE’S OR SERVICE’S USE OR PERFORMANCE. WE DO NOT WARRANT OR GUARANTEE THAT THE SOFTWARE’S OR SERVICE’S OPERATION WILL BE FAILSAFE, UNINTERRUPTED, OR FREE FROM ERRORS OR DEFECTS, OR THAT THE SOFTWARE OR SERVICES WILL PROTECT AGAINST ALL POSSIBLE SECURITY THREATS (INCLUDING INTENTIONAL MISCONDUCT BY THIRD PARTIES), THAT THERE WILL BE NO MALFUNCTIONS OR OTHER ERRORS IN THE SOFTWARE OR SERVICES CAUSED BY VIRUS, INFECTION, WORM OR SIMILAR MALICIOUS CODE NOT INTRODUCED OR DEVELOPED BY US, OR THAT THE SOFTWARE OR SERVICES WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS. WE ARE NOT LIABLE FOR ANY DOWNTIME OR SERVICE INTERRUPTION, FOR ANY LOST OR STOLEN DATA OR SYSTEMS, OR FOR ANY OTHER DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO ANY ACTIONS OR INTRUSIONS.</p>
  <p><strong>High Risk Activities</strong>. The Software and Services are not fault-tolerant and is not designed or intended for high-risk activities such as use in hazardous environments requiring failsafe performance, including nuclear-facilities operations, air traffic communication systems, weapons systems, direct life-support machines, or any other application in which the failure of the Software or Services could lead directly to death, personal injury, or severe physical or property damage. We expressly disclaim any express or implied warranty of fitness for high-risk activities.</p>
  <p><strong>Limitation of Liability</strong>. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES ARE WE OR OUR SUPPLIERS, LICENSORS OR OTHER THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY: (I) INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES; (II) THEFT OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION OR COST OF PROCURING SUBSTITUTE SOFTWARE OR SERVICES, AND (III) DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, LOSS OF PERSONNEL SALARIES, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, LOSS OF DATA, OR NEGLIGENCE OF ANY KIND, OR FOR ANY OTHER INDIRECT DAMAGE OR LOSS. IN NO EVENT WILL OUR, OUR AFFILIATES’ OR OUR SUPPLIERS’, LICENSORS’ OR OTHER THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS’ AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO YOU FOR DIRECT DAMAGES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED THE PRICE YOU PAID FOR THE APPLICABLE SOFTWARE, OR USD $100 (OR THE EQUIVALENT AMOUNT IN NATIONAL CURRENCY) IF YOU USED FREE SOFTWARE. You agree to the limitations of liability in this Section and acknowledge that without your agreement to this term, the fee charged for the Software would be higher.

Export to a particular individual, entity, or country may be prohibited by law. Information about import restrictions can be found at the following websites: <u>https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Pages/default.aspx</u> and <u>https://export.gov/ecr/eg_main_023148.asp</u>.</p>

Those third-party materials may include software source code licensed by third parties under one or more open-source or free-software licenses, including the GNU General Public License, which are considered “Open Source Software.” The Open Source Software is licensed under terms and conditions different from this Agreement and may, in some cases, conflict with the terms of this Agreement and will apply instead of the terms of this Agreement. If an Open Source Software license requires us to distribute any source code related to the Software or Services or any modifications to the Software or Services, we will make the source code available on request.</p>
  <p><strong>No Waiver</strong>. We do not waive any provision of this Agreement unless we waive it in a signed writing.</p>
  <p><strong>Severability</strong>.

<p><b><i><u> What this WarrantyCovers </u></i></b>
</p>

Lenovo warrants that each Lenovo hardware product that you
purchase is free from defects in materials and workmanship under normal use
during the warranty period. The warranty period
for the product
starts on the original date of purchase as shown on your sales receipt or
invoice or as may be otherwise specified by Lenovo.  The warranty period and
type of warranty service that apply to your product are as specified in "<b>Part
3 - Warranty Service Information</b>" below.  This warranty only applies
to products in the country or region of purchase. </i>
</p>

<p><b><i>THIS WARRANTY IS YOUR EXCLUSIVE
WARRANTY AND REPLACES ALL OTHER WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. AS SOME STATES OR
JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, THE
ABOVE EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.  IN THAT EVENT, SUCH WARRANTIES APPLY

LIMITATIONS ON THE DURATION OF AN IMPLIED WARRANTY, THE ABOVE LIMITATION ON
DURATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. </i></b></p>


<p><b><i><u> How to Obtain Warranty Service </u></i></b>
</p>

<p><i>If the product does not function as warranted
during the warranty period, you may obtain warranty service by contacting
Lenovo or a Lenovo approved Service Provider. A list of approved Service
Providers and their telephone numbers is available at: <u>https://pcsupport.lenovo.com/supportphonelist</u>.</i>
</p>

<p><i>Warranty service may not be

Service Provider for information specific to your location.</i>
</p>

<p><b><i><u>Customer Responsibilities for Warranty Service</u></i></b>
</p>

<p><i> 
Before warranty
service is provided, you must take the following steps:  </i>

Service Provider </i>
</li>

<li><i>backup or secure all programs and data contained in the
product </i>
</li>

<li><i>provide the Service Provider with all system keys or
passwords </i>
</li>

<li><i>provide the Service Provider with sufficient, free, and
safe access to your facilities to perform service  </i>
</li>

<li><i>remove all data, including confidential information,
proprietary information and personal information, from the product or, if you
are unable to remove any such information, modify the information to prevent
its access by another party or so that it is not personal data under applicable
law. The Service Provider shall not be responsible for the loss or disclosure
of any data, including confidential information, proprietary information, or
personal information, on a product returned or accessed for warranty service </i>

</li>
</ul>

<p><b><i><u> 
 What Your Service Provider Will Do to Correct Problems  </u></i></b>
</p>

<p><i> 
When you contact a
Service Provider, you must follow the specified problem determination and
resolution procedures. </i>
</p>

<p><i> 
The Service Provider
will attempt to diagnose and resolve your problem by telephone, e-mail or
remote assistance.  The Service Provider may direct you to download and install
designated software updates. </i>
</p>

<p><i> 
Some
problems may be resolved with a replacement part that you install yourself
called a "Customer Replaceable Unit" or "CRU."   If so, the Service Provider
will ship the CRU to you for you to install.   </i>
</p>

<p><i> 
If your problem cannot
be resolved over the telephone; through the application of software updates or
the installation of a CRU, the Service Provider will arrange for service under
the type of warranty service designated for the product under "<b>Part 3 -
Warranty Service Information</b>" below.   </i>
</p>

<p><i> 
If the Service
Provider determines that it is unable to repair your product, the Service
Provider will replace it with one that is at least functionally equivalent.  </i>
</p>

<p><i>  
If the Service Provider determines that it is
unable to either repair or replace your product, your sole remedy under this
Limited Warranty is to return the product to your place of purchase or to
Lenovo for a refund of your purchase price.  </i></p>


<p><b><i><u> Replacement Products and Parts </u></i></b>

<h3 class="warr">Part 3 - Warranty Service Information </h3>

</div>

<p>The warranty period may vary by country
or region and is specified in the printed warranty documentation that came with
your computer. 
</p>

<p>If
required, the Service Provider will provide repair or exchange service
depending on the type of warranty service specified for your product and the
available service. Scheduling of service will depend upon the time of your
call, parts availability, and other factors.  
</p>

<p><b><u>Types of Warranty Service </u></b>
</p>

<p><b>  
1.  Customer Replaceable Unit ("CRU") Service</b> 
</p>

<p>Under CRU Service, the Service Provider will
ship CRUs to you at its cost for installation by you.  CRU information and
replacement instructions are shipped with your product and are available from
Lenovo at any time upon request.  CRUs that are easily installed by you are
called "Self-service    
CRUs". "Optional-service CRUs "are CRUs that may require
some technical skill and tools. 
Installation of Self-service CRUs is your
responsibility.  You may request that a Service Provider install
Optional-service CRUs under one of the other types of warranty service
designated for your product.  An optional service offering may be available for
purchase from a Service Provider or Lenovo under which Self-service CRUs would
be installed for you.  You may find a list of CRUs and their designation in the
publication that was shipped with your product or at <u> https://pcsupport.lenovo.com/solutions/hf002201</u>.  The requirement to
return a defective CRU, if any, will be specified in the instructions shipped
with a replacement CRU.  When return is required:  1) return instructions, a
prepaid return shipping label, and a container will be included with the
replacement CRU; and 2) you may be charged for the replacement CRU if the
Service Provider does not receive the defective CRU from you within thirty (30)
days of your receipt of the replacement CRU.   
</p>

<p><b>2. On-site Service </b>
</p>

<p>Under On-Site Service, a Service Provider
will either repair or exchange the product at your location. You must provide a
suitable working area to allow disassembly and reassembly of the product.  
Some repairs may need to be completed at a service center.  If so, the Service
Provider will send the product to the service center at its expense. 
</p>


<p><b>3. Courier or Depot Service </b>
</p>

<p>Under Courier or Depot Service, your product
will be repaired or exchanged at a designated service center, with shipping at
the expense of the Service Provider.  You are responsible for disconnecting the
product and packing it in a shipping container provided to you to return your
product to a designated service center. A
courier will pick up your product and deliver it to the designated service
center. The service center will return the product to you at its
expense.  
</p>


<p><b>4. Customer Carry-In Service </b>
</p>

<p>Under Customer Carry-In Service, your product
will be repaired or exchanged after you deliver it to a designated service
center at your risk and expense.  After the product has been repaired or
exchanged, it will be made available to you for collection. If you fail to
collect the product, the Service Provider may dispose of the product as it sees
fit, with no liability to you.   
</p>

<p><b>5. Mail-In Service </b>
</p>

<p>Under Mail-In Service, your product will be
repaired or exchanged at a designated service center after you deliver it at
your risk and expense. After the product has been repaired or exchanged, it
will be returned to you at Lenovo's risk and expense, unless the Service
Provider specifies otherwise.  
</p>

<p><b>6. Customer Two-Way Mail-In Service </b>
</p>

<p>Under Customer Two-Way Mail-In Service, your
product will be repaired or exchanged after you deliver it to a designated
service center at your risk and expense.  After the product has been repaired
or exchanged, it will be made available to you for return shipping at your risk
and expense.  If you fail to arrange return shipment, the Service Provider may
dispose of the product as it sees fit, with no liability to you. 
</p>

<p><b> 7. Product Exchange Service </b>
</p>

<p>Under Product Exchange Service, Lenovo will
ship a replacement product to your location.  You are responsible for its
installation and verification of its operation.  The replacement product becomes
your property in exchange for the failed product, which becomes the property of
Lenovo.  You must pack the failed product in the shipping carton in which you
received the replacement product and return it to Lenovo.  Transportation
charges, both ways, shall be at Lenovo's expense.  If you fail to use the
carton in which the replacement product was received, you may be responsible
for any damage to the failed product occurring during shipment.  You may be
charged for the replacement product if Lenovo does not receive the failed
product within thirty (30) days of your receipt of the replacement product.
