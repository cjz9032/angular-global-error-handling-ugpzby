<hr />
<p>Cortana is your digital agent. She'll help you get things done.</p>
<p>The more you use Cortana, the more personalized your experience will be.</p>
<p>To get started, type a question in the search box, or select the microphone&nbsp;&nbsp;and talk to Cortana. (Typing
	works for all types of PCs, but you need a mic to talk.)</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not sure what to say, you&rsquo;ll see suggestions on your lock screen, and in Cortana home when you
	select the search box on the taskbar.</p>

<h3 style='font-weight:bold;font-size:2.5rem;padding:10px 0'>Try this: Set a reminder</h3>
<hr />

<p>One of the things Cortana can do is to give you reminders. She can remind you to do things based on time, places, or
	even people.</p>
<p>For example, type or say, 'Remind me to congratulate Tanya the next time she calls.'</p>
<p>The reminder will appear when you get a call from Tanya.</p>
<p>Extra bonus&mdash;if you have a Windows phone or Cortana for iPhone or Android, you can set Cortana to sync
	notifications between your PC and phone.</p>
