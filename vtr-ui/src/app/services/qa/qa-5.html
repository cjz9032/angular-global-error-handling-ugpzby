<p>Tablet mode makes Windows more intuitive and easier to use when you have a touchscreen device.</p>

<h3 style='font-weight:bold;font-size:2.5rem;padding:10px 0'>Use tablet mode</h3>
<p>To turn on tablet mode, select <strong>action center</strong> on the taskbar,&nbsp;then select <strong>Tablet
		mode</strong> .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3 style='font-weight:bold;font-size:2.5rem;padding:10px 0'>Note</h3>
<p>To find out if your device&nbsp;can automatically turn on tablet mode, search for your device&nbsp;
	on the manufacturer's website. Support for this feature depends on the hardware, the driver that's installed, and
	how the device was set up by the manufacturer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In tablet mode, apps open full screen, giving you more space to work. To close an app, drag it to the bottom of the
	screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style='font-weight:bold;font-size:2.5rem;padding:10px 0'>Tip</h3>
<p>The taskbar is available when your PC is in tablet mode, but you can hide it if you want more room on the screen.
	Select the <strong>Start </strong>button, select <strong>Settings </strong>&gt;
	<strong>System </strong>&gt; <strong>
		Tablet mode </strong>,&nbsp;then turn on <strong>Automatically hide the taskbar in tablet mode</strong>.
	To see the hidden taskbar, swipe up from the bottom of the screen, or use your&nbsp;mouse to hover there.</p>

<h3 style='font-weight:bold;font-size:2.5rem;padding:10px 0'>Use two apps simultaneously</h3>
<p>To use two apps side by side in tablet mode, drag an open app down and to the side. You'll see where it'll snap, and
	you'll see any open apps&nbsp;next to it.</p>
<p>In this view, you can also:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Use the shared edge between two snapped apps to resize both apps at the same time.</li>
	<li>Open a&nbsp;new app from task view&mdash;select <strong>Task view</strong> on the taskbar, select an app, then
		drag it to one side to snap it into your divided screen.</li>
	<li>Use the back button on the taskbar to go back in an app, or to open an&nbsp;app that you were using before.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
