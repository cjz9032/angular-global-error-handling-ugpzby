		<p>Enabling a custom battery charge will allow for the overall battery health to last longer as you use this
			device. However, not having a full charge will allow less runtime battery life.</p>
		<p>In order to fully enable this feature, please unplug your machine and allow your battery to drain to or
			below the stop-charging threshold.</p>
