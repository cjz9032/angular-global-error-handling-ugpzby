<h2 id="myth-1-only-criminals-have-to-worry-about-online-privacy">Myth #1: Only criminals have to worry about online
	privacy</h2>
<p>It’s a common misconception that individuals who engage in suspicious or criminal behavior online are the only people
	who have to worry about privacy. Privacy, however, is a universal concern. Just because you have nothing to hide
	doesn’t mean you’re invulnerable to privacy breaches.</p>
<p>Many companies today use your personal information in ways you may not be comfortable with. Websites and apps can
	monitor your digital behavior, for example, gather data on your location, habits, and preferences, then use this
	data to generate a profit, either by sending you targeted ads or selling your data to third parties. This type of
	data tracking can feel invasive and frustrating, especially if you don’t consent to it.</p>
<h2 id="myth-2-deleting-cookies-improves-your-privacy">Myth #2: Deleting cookies improves your privacy</h2>
<p>Cookies, small data files stored by your local web browser, contain a wealth of information about your online
	behavior, including your favorite websites, search history, and login information. You might assume, then, that
	deleting your cookies increases your privacy by making it more difficult for companies to track you. Unfortunately,
	this isn’t necessarily the case.</p>
<p>You can delete your cookies, but they’ll likely just be reconstructed unless you change certain browser settings and
	delete your cache and history as well. Disabling cookies and resetting your browser doesn’t protect your device from
	fingerprinting, though.</p>
<p>Companies and internet service providers (ISPs) can still gather information on your browser type, operating system,
	time zone, screen resolution, and plug-ins even without cookies. These unique details come together to form your
	device’s fingerprint, which can then be used to identify you.</p>
<h2 id="myth-3-closing-apps-protects-your-privacy">Myth #3: Closing apps protects your privacy</h2>
<p>Most apps disclose the fact that they’re gathering your data when you use them. What you may not know, however, is
	that certain privacy definitions allow these apps to access your data even when you’re not using them. In other
	words, closing an app on your device doesn’t necessarily guarantee your privacy.</p>
<p>Many apps, for example, are automatically set to track your location at all times, including when the app is closed.
	Though the most common location tracking apps are GPS-related, there are plenty of other ones that demand access to
	your whereabouts, including weather apps, ride sharing apps, news apps, restaurant reservation apps, travel apps,
	and hotel booking apps. Unless you actively disable these settings, you could be unknowingly sharing sensitive
	personal data with businesses and advertisers, whether you want to or not.</p>
<p>In fact, a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/12/10/business/location-data-privacy-apps.html">2018
		report from The New York Times</a> found that at least 75 companies receive “precise location data from apps
	whose users enable location services to get local news and weather or other information.” The same report also
	identified more than 25 other companies that said they sell location data to businesses for targeted advertising
	purposes.</p>
<h2 id="myth-4-using-private-or-incognito-mode-offers-maximum-privacy">Myth #4: Using private or incognito mode offers
	maximum privacy</h2>
<p>The majority of popular web browsers give users the option to open new tabs or windows in private or incognito mode,
	which provides a degree of anonymity when surfing the web. However, these modes aren’t fast tracks to total privacy.
</p>
<p>Private or incognito mode is perfect for a task like checking email on a public computer or buying a gift for a
	family member, since it hides your browsing history and cache from anyone using your computer. In addition to giving
	you a blank slate for each browsing session, it also doesn’t store cookies or personal information.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean it can prevent websites and ISPs from identifying you, though. The sites you visit may not have
	access to your cookies in incognito mode, but website hosts can still gather information by fingerprinting your
	device, identifying your IP address, and sending tracking data back to their servers.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.blaseur.com/papers/www18privatebrowsing.pdf">2018 study from the University of Chicago</a>
	found that many people overestimate the protections private mode offers. For example, 56.3% of participants thought
	that when they were logged into Google on private mode, their search queries wouldn’t be saved. However, that’s not
	true; using private mode prevents your search history from being saved on your local web browser, but Google can
	still access your searches.</p>
<h2 id="myth-5-you-don’t-really-have-any-control-over-your-privacy-online">Myth #5: You don’t really have any control
	over your privacy online</h2>
<p>The increase in data collection and tracking has gradually changed the definition of privacy — from something most
	people feel they have control over to something they’re forced to surrender.</p>
<p>According to a <a
		href="https://blog.treasuredata.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ATD_StateOfPrivacy_Survey18.pdf">2018 survey from
		Arm Treasure Data</a>, over 64% of consumers are concerned about companies like Google and Facebook monitoring
	their online behavior, but 46.5% of consumers either aren’t doing anything about it or don’t know what to do.</p>

<p>Fortunately, there are concrete things you can do to protect your privacy. Here are four smart rules to follow:</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		<p>Use discretion when downloading apps that have too many risky permissions</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Turn off your location sharing settings when you’re not using your apps</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Carefully read the disclaimers when syncing your apps with your social media accounts</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Review your Facebook privacy settings to make sure you’re comfortable with everything</p>
	</li>
</ol>
<p>You can also download and use a virtual private network (VPN) to help encrypt your data. A VPN isn’t a perfect
	solution, but it can help limit the amount of data companies acquire about you. It works by routing your data
	through an encrypted tunnel to a separate server run by the VPN; that way, no one connected to your router,
	including your ISP, can see your web behavior.</p>
<p>How to regain control over your privacy</p>
<p>You shouldn’t have to give up your privacy if you don’t want to. The new definition of privacy should take your
	personal needs into account. Not only should you have the ability to choose how visible you are no matter where you
	go online, you should also be able to adjust that visibility as often as you want.</p>
<p>The beauty of the internet is the freedom it offers — freedom to explore and express yourself on your terms. <a
